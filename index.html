        My name is Steve Amos, and I am an expert graphics designer from Nigeria. 
        Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Programming at 
        Brigham Young University-Idaho. My passion for technology and creativity 
        drives me to excel in both design and coding. <br> With a strong background 
        in graphic design, I create compelling visuals for digital and print media. 
        My skills in various design tools and techniques ensure that each project 
        meets high aesthetic and communicative standards. In addition to design, 
        my academic journey has equipped me with solid programming skills, allowing 
        me to develop visually appealing and functionally robust web and mobile applications. <br>
        I enjoy staying updated with the latest industry trends and continuously 
        learning new technologies. I work both remotely and onsite, 
        bringing professionalism and creativity to every project. <br>
        I am open to remote job opportunities that leverage my skills in graphic design and 
        programming, eager to collaborate with teams and clients worldwide. <br>
        Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I look forward to the 
        possibility of working together.
